To what  extent do you agree?<br /><br /> Randa Abdel-Fattah's modern  Australian novelWhen  Michael Met Minafollows the dual  narrative of the titular high school students who are affected by the  influence of stereotypes and preconceptions. Through the eyes of both Michael  and Mina, Abdel-Fattah emphasises the critical importance of questioning and  challenging stereotypes. While characters that blindly accept stereotypes are  initially presented in a sympathetic light, those that play a more active  role in the spread of stereotypes are criticised by Abdel-Fattah. Meanwhile,  those who actively challenge these small-minded ideas are presented in a more  progressive, positive light as the novel progresses. Abdel-Fattah offers a  clear perspective about the negative role of stereotypes.|

|* The role of your        conclusion is to bring your ideas together - after going through all        your ideas, evidence, and explanation, what are the main 'take-aways'        you want to leave your reader with?* 'Recap' the key ideas of        your paragraphs, in a brief, efficient way - just a sentence or two.* Connective words like'thus',        'therefore', 'overall', 'as such'can help to start your conclusion with a sense ofmomentumandfinality. Avoid 'In        conclusion...'as        this is seen as a bit simple and obvious.* Avoid bringing in any new        ideas/evidence/quotes - you should have used these already!|

|* IF you find it hard to        start your introduction: When writing your essay, leave a gap where        your introduction should go, and write your body paragraphs first.        After you have written your body paragraphs, you will be able to more        effectively 'introduce' them in your introduction.* This also means that you        are writing your conclusion right after your introduction, making it        easier to avoid repetition in both. * Brainstorming synonyms for        the key words in the essay prompt will help you have some variety in        your introduction and conclusion.|
