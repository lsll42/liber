# writing-work-GRE-argument-1

The following appeared in an article written by Dr. Karp, an anthropologist.
&quot;Twenty years ago, Dr. Field, a noted anthropologist, visited the island of Tertia and
concluded from his observations that children in Tertia were reared by an entire
village rather than by their own biological parents. However, my recent interviews
with children living in the group of islands that includes Tertia show that these
children spend much more time talking about their biological parents than about
other adults in the village. This research of mine proves that Dr. Field's conclusion
about Tertian village culture is invalid and thus that the observation-centered
approach to studying cultures is invalid as well. The interview-centered method that
my team of graduate students is currently using in Tertia will establish a much
more accurate understanding of child-rearing traditions there and in other island
cultures.&quot;
Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the
argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and
what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

## arguments

* 20 years ago Dr field concluded that children in Tertia were reared by the entire village rather than by their own parents through observation. However, "my" interview show that children spend much more time talking about their parents than other adults.

* This therefore proves that Dr field is wrong and that it is also wrong to use the observation-centered approach to study cultures

* "My" interview-centered approach (which my team of students is using) will establish a more accurate understanding of child-rearing traditions.

## assumptions

the author has made these assumptions:

* the situation in Tertia is the same now as it was 20 years ago

* the amount of time a child spends talking about their parent is directly proportional to how much they were reared by their own parents

* interview methods are more reliable than observational methods.

* interview methods are more accurate and therefore should be used to study cultures

* best methods for understanding child-rearing traditions is congruous through all cultures

## essay

In response to the study concerning children in Tertia, Dr. Karp argues that using the interview-centered approach will establish a more accurate underestanfing of child-rearing traditions than the observation-centered approach. Dr. Karp does this by using brute logic and evidence to support their argument.

According to Dr. Karp's observations, Dr. Field, a "noted anthropologist", concluded 20 years ago that "children in Tertia were reared by an entirevillage rather than by their own biological parents." Contrastingly, Dr. Karp's interviews suggested that "these children spend much more time talking about their biological parents than aboutother adults in the village," therefore showing how Dr. Field's conclusion was wrong and that it is also inadequate to use the observation-centered approach to study cultures. Dr. Karp then concludes that their interview-centered approach will establish a more accurate understanding of child-rearing traditions everywhere.

However, Dr. Karp assumes that child-rearing cultures in Tertia has been consistent in the last 20 years; should this assumption prove unwarranted, it cannot be concluded that it is inadequate to use the observation-centered approach to study cultures. Furthermore, Dr. Karp suggests that interview methods are more reliable than observational methods, which cannot be proven without sufficient evidence regarding how reliable these sources are. Additionally, there is no evidence to advocate that interview methods are more accurate.

The argument depends on these assumptions as to provide evidence for Dr. Karp's argument; they justify Dr. Karp's arguments whilst invalidating Dr. Field's. These assumptions serve a critical role in providing evidence for argument and persuasion, but are based upon false grounds and are not to be expected in a persuasive article by an anthropologist, whose job is to think logically about cultures and the methods involved with studying them.

Ultimately, Dr. Karp's article does not sufficient evidence for his arguments; there were a multitude of falsey assumptions which cannot support their argument.

 Here are some key questions that would need to be answered to evaluate the reasonableness of the prediction that residents of Mentia will suffer fewer headaches due to increased salicylate consumption:

- What was the timeframe of the study? A longer-term study would provide more reliable data than a short-term study. Knowing the timeframe would help assess the strength of the correlation found between salicylate use and fewer headaches.

- How was headache frequency tracked? Were study participants reporting their own headaches or was there an objective measurement? Self-reported data is less reliable than objective measures.

- Were other factors that could influence headache frequency controlled for? Things like stress, diet, lifestyle changes, and other medication use could all impact headaches. The study needs to isolate the effect of salicylates specifically.

- What was the sample size of the study? The larger the sample size the more likely it is to reflect the overall population. A small sample could skew results.

- Is there a plausible biological mechanism to explain how salicylates relieve headaches? Establishing this biological connection would strengthen the causation argument.

- Could the decline in headaches be related to other factors that changed during the 20 year timeframe? Were other public health or lifestyle changes occurring during this period that could explain the decline in headaches?

- Is there a maximum dosage where salicylates are no longer effective or start causing adverse effects? Higher doses may not continue to reduce headaches or could even cause headaches. Dosage needs to be considered.

Overall, the argument depends on showing a direct causal link between increased salicylates and fewer headaches in Mentia residents. More rigorous, controlled study accounting for other variables would be needed to confirm this connection and support the prediction. The questions above could help determine if the conclusion is justified by the evidence provided.

The argument presented suggests that the consumption of salicylates, either naturally occurring in foods or added as preservatives and flavor additives, is associated with a decline in the average number of headaches among residents of Mentia. The prediction is that this trend will continue, resulting in even fewer headaches in the future. To evaluate the reasonableness of this prediction and the argument supporting it, several critical questions need to be answered:

1. **Causation vs. Correlation**: Does the study establish a causal relationship between the consumption of salicylates and the decline in headaches, or is it merely a correlation? Understanding whether salicylates are the direct cause of reduced headaches is crucial.

2. **Controlled Variables**: Were other factors controlled for in the study? For example, were lifestyle changes, diet modifications, or the use of other headache medications taken into account when attributing the reduction in headaches to salicylates?

3. **Dosage and Duration**: What is the optimal dosage and duration of salicylate consumption required to achieve this effect? Is there a threshold beyond which it becomes harmful, or are there diminishing returns over time?

4. **Participant Demographics**: Are there variations in the response to salicylates among different age groups, genders, or other demographic factors? Is the study representative of the entire population of Mentia?

5. **Adverse Effects**: Are there any adverse health effects associated with increased salicylate consumption, such as gastrointestinal issues, allergies, or other medical concerns? These side effects could offset the benefits of reduced headaches.

6. **Long-Term Health Implications**: What are the potential long-term health consequences of continued or increased salicylate consumption? Are there any risks associated with this trend?

7. **Salicylate Sources**: What are the primary sources of salicylates in the Mentia residents' diets? Are these sources being maintained and do they represent a substantial portion of daily intake?

8. **Quality of Life**: Does the reduction in headaches translate to an overall improvement in residents' quality of life? Or are there other factors that might affect their well-being negatively, such as the taste or nutritional value of foods with added salicylates?

9. **Food Industry Practices**: Are there regulations in place to monitor the use of salicylates in foods as preservatives and flavor additives? What is the oversight and quality control for such practices?

10. **Alternative Explanations**: Could there be other factors influencing the decline in headaches? For example, changes in healthcare, environmental factors, or public awareness campaigns promoting healthier living.

11. **Predictive Power**: Can the trend observed in this study be reliably extrapolated into the future, or are there unforeseen factors that could disrupt the correlation between salicylate consumption and headaches?

In summary, while the initial study suggests a promising link between salicylate consumption and reduced headaches, there are numerous critical questions that need to be answered to determine the validity of the prediction and the argument. A comprehensive analysis of these factors is necessary to make an informed assessment of the situation in Mentia.

The prediction that residents of Mentia will suffer even fewer headaches in the future is based on the argument that consuming salicylates has a therapeutic effect on headaches, and that salicylates are increasingly used as flavor additives for foods. To evaluate the reasonableness of this prediction and argument, the following questions would need to be answered:

- **Is the correlation between the rise in the commercial use of salicylates and the decline in the average number of headaches reported by study participants causal?** Correlation does not imply causation, and there could be other factors that influence the frequency of headaches, such as stress levels, environmental conditions, genetic predisposition, or other dietary habits. To establish a causal relationship, the study would need to control for these confounding variables and show that salicylates have a direct effect on reducing headaches.
- **Are the study participants representative of the general population of Mentia?** The study results may not be generalizable if the sample size is too small, the selection criteria are biased, or the demographics are not diverse. To ensure validity, the study would need to use a large, random, and representative sample of Mentia residents who suffer from headaches.
- **How much salicylates do people need to consume to have a therapeutic effect on headaches?** The study does not specify the dosage or frequency of salicylate intake by the participants, nor does it compare the natural and artificial sources of salicylates. To determine the optimal amount of salicylates for headache relief, the study would need to measure and compare the salicylate levels in different foods and in the blood of the participants.
- **Are there any negative side effects or risks associated with consuming salicylates?** Salicylates are members of the same chemical family as aspirin, which can cause allergic reactions, stomach ulcers, bleeding disorders, or liver damage in some people. To assess the safety and efficacy of salicylates, the study would need to monitor and report any adverse effects or complications experienced by the participants.

The answers to these questions would help to evaluate the prediction and argument by testing their assumptions, validity, reliability, and implications. Without sufficient evidence and explanation, the prediction and argument are not reasonable.

The argument presented in the study is that the consumption of salicylates has a therapeutic effect on headaches. The study found a correlation between the rise in commercial use of salicylates and a steady decline in the average number of headaches reported by study participants. Based on these results, some health experts predict that residents of Mentia will suffer even fewer headaches in the future.

To evaluate this prediction, we need to answer several questions:

1. What is the sample size of the study? Was it large enough to be representative of the entire population of Mentia?
2. What was the control group in the study? Was there a group that did not consume salicylates?
3. What was the dosage of salicylates consumed by the participants? Was it consistent across all participants?
4. Were there any side effects reported by participants who consumed salicylates?
5. How long did participants consume salicylates? Was it for the entire duration of the study?
6. What is the mechanism by which salicylates reduce headaches? Is it well understood?
7. Are there any other factors that could have contributed to the decline in headaches, such as changes in lifestyle or environmental factors?

Answering these questions would help us evaluate whether the prediction and argument are reasonable. For example, if we find that there was no control group in the study, then we cannot conclude that salicylates were responsible for reducing headaches. Similarly, if we find that there were side effects reported by participants who consumed salicylates, then we need to consider whether these side effects outweigh the benefits of consuming salicylates.

Therefore, it is important to consider all relevant factors before making any conclusions about the therapeutic effect of consuming salicylates on headaches.

To evaluate the prediction and the argument on which it is based, we would need to answer several questions:

1. **Correlation vs Causation**: The study found a correlation between the rise in the commercial use of salicylates and a decline in the average number of headaches. However, correlation does not imply causation. Were there any other factors that could have contributed to the decline in headaches? For example, changes in lifestyle, diet, stress levels, or even weather conditions?

2. **Control Group**: Was there a control group in the study that did not consume salicylates? Comparing the results between a group that consumed salicylates and one that did not could provide more conclusive evidence.

3. **Dosage and Concentration**: What was the concentration of salicylates in the foods consumed by the study participants? Is it comparable to the concentration used in aspirin?

4. **Side Effects**: Are there any potential side effects from consuming salicylates, especially over a long period? Could these side effects outweigh the potential benefits?

5. **Demographics**: Were the study participants representative of the general population of Mentia? Factors such as age, gender, health conditions could influence the results.

6. **Flavor Additives vs Preservatives**: The study mentions that salicylates are used as preservatives and are now being considered as flavor additives. Could the method of use affect its therapeutic effect?

The answers to these questions would help determine whether the prediction is reasonable and whether increasing the use of salicylates in food would indeed lead to fewer headaches among residents of Mentia.
