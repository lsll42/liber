what causes objects to move the way that they do?

### newton's first law

an object acted on by no net external force has a constant velocity and zero acceleration.

### newton's second law

if a net external force acts on an object, the object's acceleration will change. the direction of acceleration increment is the same as the direction of the net external force. the net external force vector divided by object mass is equal to the acceleration vector.

### newton's third law

if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B exerts a force of same magnitude but opposite direction on object A. these two forces act on objects A and B.
