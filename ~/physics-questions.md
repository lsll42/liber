Q4.1 Can an object be in equilibrium when only one force acts on it? Explain.
this needs the vector sum of all the forces on the object to be zero, so if only one force acts upon it, then it is not i equilibrium.

Q4.2 A ball thrown straight up has zero velocity at its highest point. Is the ball in equilibrium at this point? Why or why not?
this needs the vector sum of all the forces on the object to be zero, so if only gravity acts upon it, then it is not i equilibrium.

Q4.3 A helium balloon hovers in midair, neither ascending nor descending. Is it in equilibrium? What forces act on it?
this needs the vector sum of all the forces on the object to be zero. there's the lift provided by the hot air and the pull of gravity, which are the same, so it is in equilibrium.

Q4.4 When you fly in an airplane at night in smooth air, you have no sensation of motion, even though the plane may be moving at 800 km>h. Why?
the plane is a closed environment with constant acceleration. everything in the closed environment has the same acceleration so you have no sensation of motion. however, when the plane's acceleration changes, your inertia causes you to resist changes in acceleration, so you get pressed back to your seat.

Q4.5 If the two ends of a rope in equilibrium are pulled with forces of equal magnitude and opposite directions, why isn’t the total tension in the rope zero?
although the acceleration of the rope is zero, tension is how much the rope is

Q4.6 You tie a brick to the end of a rope and whirl the brick around you in a horizontal circle. Describe the path of the brick after you suddenly let go of the rope.
without the tension of the rope the brick would accelerate towards the direction of the rope when it was released.

Q4.7 When a car stops suddenly, the passengers tend to move forward relative to their seats. Why? When a car makes a sharp turn, the passengers tend to slide to one side of the car. Why?
this is because of inertia; see Q4.4

Q4.8 Some people say that the “force of inertia” (or “force of momentum”) throws the passengers forward when a car brakes sharply. What is wrong with this explanation?
the change in acceleration causes this, not inertia.

Q4.9 A passenger in a moving bus with no windows notices that a ball that has been at rest in the aisle suddenly starts to move toward the rear of the bus. Think of two possible explanations, and devise a way to decide which is correct.
the bus is moving uphill and ball is pulled by gravity
the bus acceleration changes so that ball moves

Q4.10 Suppose you chose the fundamental physical quantities to be force, length, and time instead of mass, length, and time. What would be the units of mass in terms of those fundamental quantities?
newtons

Q4.11 Why is the earth only approximately an inertial reference frame?
non-inertial effects can be caused by the earth's rotation and orbit around the sun; this leads to the presence of centrifugal forces, which are considered fictitious forces

Q4.12 Does Newton’s second law hold true for an observer in a van as it speeds up, slows down, or rounds a corner? Explain.
newton's second law says that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F=ma). this holds true for the observer in the van because the inertial force does account for this law

Q4.22 A large crate is suspended from the end of a vertical rope. Is the tension in the rope greater when the crate is at rest or when it is moving upward at constant speed? If the crate is traveling upward, is the tension in the rope greater when the crate is speeding up or when it is slowing down? In each case, explain in terms of Newton’s laws of motion.

Q4.23 Which feels a greater pull due to the earth’s gravity: a 10 kg stone or a 20 kg stone? If you drop the two stones, why doesn’t the 20 kg stone fall with twice the acceleration of the 10 kg stone? Explain.

Q4.24 A horse is hitched to a wagon. Since the wagon pulls back on the horse just as hard as the horse pulls on the wagon, why doesn’t the wagon remain in equilibrium, no matter how hard the horse pulls?
motion is relative to the ground, and the wagon has less friction on the ground compared to the horse, so the wagon moves

Q4.25 True or false? You exert a push P on an object and it pushes back on you with a force F. If the object is moving at constant velocity, then F is equal to P, but if the object is being accelerated, then P must be greater than F.
according to the second newton law, the forces acting on both objects are always the same, regardless of acceleration.

Q4.13 Some students refer to the quantity maS as “the force of acceleration.” Is it correct to refer to this quantity as a force? If so, what exerts this force? If not, what is a better description of this quantity?
maS is known as force due to acceleration or net force. a better description of this would be the force due to acceleration or net force.

Q4.14 The acceleration of a falling object is measured in a lift that is traveling upward at a constant speed of 9.8 m>s. What value is obtained?

Q4.15 You can play catch with a softball in a bus moving with constant speed on a straight road, just as though the bus were at rest. Is this still possible when the bus is making a turn at constant speed on a level road? Why or why not?

Q4.17 Why can it hurt your foot more to kick a big rock than a small pebble? Must the big rock hurt more? Explain.
Bid rocks have more mass and therefore a greater amount of force is needed to accelerate it.

Q4.18 “It’s not the fall that hurts you; it’s the sudden stop at the bottom.” Translate this saying into the language of Newton’s laws of motion.
the acceleration towards the ground cannot hurt you but when you hit the ground the ground will exert a great amount of force on you which means that you'll hurt

Q4.19 A person can dive into water from a height of 10 m without injury, but a person who jumps off the roof of a 10-m-tall building and lands on a concrete street is likely to be seriously injured. Why is there a difference?
as a liquid, water has flexible properties that can slow down your velocity as you fall down which makes you safe

Q4.20 Why are cars designed to crumple in front and back for safety? Why not for side collisions and rollovers?
well, cars are mostly likely to crash into something or get crashed into by something on the front and back sides, not the sides.

Q4.21 When a string barely strong enough lifts a heavy weight, it can lift the weight by a steady pull; but if you jerk the string, it will break. Explain in terms of Newton’s laws of motion.
the tension of the string is only able to support a certain amount of force. as you jerk the string, the gravity accelerates the weight more, which would cause a greater force to act upon the string

Q4.36 In a head-on collision between a compact 1000 kg car and a large 2500 kg car, which one experiences the greater force? Explain. Which one experiences the greater acceleration? Explain why. Why are passengers in the small car more likely to be injured than those in the large car, even when the two car bodies are equally strong?
they experience the same force. the small car experiences more acceleration because it has less mass and therefore more acceleration. passengers in the small car are more likely to get injured because the velocity is greater.

Q4.37 Suppose you are in a rocket with no windows, traveling in deep space far from other objects. Without looking outside the rocket or making any contact with the outside world, explain how you could determine whether the rocket is (a) moving forward at a constant 80% of the speed of light and (b) accelerating in the forward direction.
you cannot know the speed of the rocket without knowing about the outside, but you can sense a change in acceleration by feeling if you're pressed back to your seat due to acceleration change

4.1 •• Two dogs pull horizontally on ropes attached to a post; the angle between the ropes is 51.0°. If Rover exerts a force of 288 N and Fido exerts a force of 324 N, find the magnitude of the resultant force
the resultant force would be 36N towards Fido

4.7 •• A 68.5 kg skater moving initially at 2.40 m>s on rough horizontal ice comes to rest uniformly in 3.52 s due to friction from the ice. What force does friction exert on the skater?
we can use the equation $v_f=v_i+at$ to calculate the constant acceleration that the ice has exerted on the skater
we get -0.682m/s^2. this means that the friction is constantly decelerating the skater. to find out the force, we can times this by the mass of the skater to get -46.7N

4.8 •• You walk into a lift, step onto a scale, and push the “up” button. You recall that your normal weight is 655 N. Draw a free-body diagram. (a) When the lift has an upward acceleration of magnitude 2.46 m>s , 2 what does the scale read? (b) If you hold a 3.65-kg package by a light vertical string, what will be the tension in this string when the lift accelerates as in part (a)?
you are pressing with a force of 665N to the elevator because of gravity, and the elevator exerts normal force of 655N on you too.

4.9 • A box rests on a frozen pond, which serves as a frictionless horizontal surface. If a fisherman applies a horizontal force with magnitude 50.0 N to the box and produces an acceleration of magnitude 3.60 m>s , what is the mass of the box?

f=ma , so the mass of the box is 13.8 kg

Q6.1 The sign of many physical quantities depends on the choice of coordinates. For example, ay for free-fall motion can be negative or positive, depending on whether we choose upward or downward as positive. Is the same true of work? In other words, can we make positive work negative by a different choice of coordinates? Explain.
work is related to energy, and therefore cannot be a negative value as this measures the amount of energy needed to do something, which is always positive.

Q6.2 A lift is hoisted by its cables at constant speed. Is the total work done on the lift positive, negative, or zero? Explain.
positive because to move the life a positive amount of work is needed

Q6.3 A rope tied to an object is pulled, causing the object to accelerate. But according to Newton’s third law, the object pulls back on the rope with a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction. Is the total work done then zero? If so, how can the object’s kinetic energy change? Explain. Q6.4 If it takes total work W to give an object a speed v and kinetic energy K, starting from rest, what will be the object’s speed (in terms of v) and kinetic energy (in terms of K) if we do twice as much work on it, again starting from rest?

Q6.5 If there is a net nonzero force on a moving object, can the total work done on the object be zero? Explain, using an example.


Q6.6 In Example 5.5 (Section 5.1), how does the work done on the bucket by the tension in the cable compare with the work done on the cart by the tension in the cable?

Q6.7 In the conical pendulum of Example 5.20 (Section 5.4), which of the forces do work on the bob while it is swinging?
Q6.8 For the cases shown in Fig. Q6.8, the object is released from rest at the top and feels no friction or air resistance. In which (if any) cases will the mass have (i) the greatest speed at the bottom and (ii) the most work done on it by the time it reaches the bottom?

(b) m (c) 2m hhh

Q6.9 A force FS is in the x-direction and has a magnitude that depends on x. Sketch a possible graph of F versus x such that the force does zero work on an object that moves from x1 to x2, even though the force magnitude is not zero at all x in this range.

Q6.10 Does a car’s kinetic energy change more when the car speeds up from 10 to 15 m>s or from 15 to 20 m>s? Explain.
Q6.11 A falling brick has a mass of 1.5 kg and is moving straight downward with a speed of 5.0 m>s. A 1.5 kg physics book is sliding across the floor with a speed of 5.0 m>s. A 1.5 kg melon is traveling with a horizontal velocity component 3.0 m>s to the right and a vertical component 4.0 m>s upward. Do all of these objects have the same velocity? Do all of them have the same ≈kinetic energy? For both questions, give your reasoning.

Q6.12 Can the total work done on an object during a displacement be negative? Explain. If the total work is negative, can its magnitude be larger than the initial kinetic energy of the object? Explain.
Q6.13 A net force acts on an object and accelerates it from rest to a speed v1. In doing so, the force does an amount of work W1. By what factor must the work done on the object be increased to produce three times the final speed, with the object again starting from rest?

Q6.14 A truck speeding down the motorway has a lot of kinetic energy relative to a stopped traffic officer but no kinetic energy relative to the truck driver. In these two frames of reference, is the same amount of work required to stop the truck? Explain.

Q6.15 You are holding a briefcase by the handle, with your arm straight down by your side. Does the force your hand exerts do work on the briefcase when (a) you walk at a constant speed down a horizontal hallway and (b) you ride a lift from the first to second floor of a building? In both cases justify your answer.

Q6.16 When a book slides along a tabletop, the force of friction does negative work on it. Can friction ever do positive work? Explain. (Hint: Think of a box in the back of an accelerating truck.)
Q6.17 Time yourself while running up a flight of steps, and compute the average rate at which you do work against the force of gravity. Q6.18 Fractured Physics. Many terms from physics are badly misused in everyday language. In both cases, explain the errors involved. (a) A strong person is called powerful. What is wrong with this use of power? (b) When a worker carries a bag of concrete along a level construction site, people say he did a lot of work. Did he?

Q6.19 An advertisement for a portable electrical generating unit claims that the unit’s diesel engine produces 20 MW to drive an electrical generator that produces 30 MW of electrical power. Is this possible? Explain.

Q6.20 A car speeds up while the engine delivers constant power. Is the acceleration greater at the beginning of this process or at the end? Explain.
Q6.21 Consider a graph of instantaneous power versus time, with the vertical P-axis starting at P = 0. What is the physical significance of the area under the P-versus-t curve between vertical lines at t1 and t2? How could you find the average power from the graph? Draw a P-versus-t curve that consists of two straight-line sections and for which the peak power is equal to twice the average power.

the following quantities to be constant: the object’s (a) speed; (b) veloc-

spring varies linearly with distance l from the fixed end. Assume also

that the mass M of the spring is distributed uniformly along the length

of the spring. (a) Calculate the kinetic energy of the spring in terms

end of a horizontal spring that obeys Hooke’s law
is attached to a wall. The spring is compressed
0.400 m, and a block with mass 0.300 kg is attached
to it. The spring is then released, and the block
moves along a horizontal surface. Electronic sen-
sors measure the speed v of the block after it has
traveled a distance d from its initial position against
the compressed spring. The measured values are
listed in the table. (a) The data show that the speed
v of the block increases and then decreases as the
spring returns to its unstretched length. Explain
why this happens, in terms of the work done on the
block by the forces that act on it. (b) Use the work–
energy theorem to derive an expression for v2 in terms of d. (c) Use a computer graphing program (for example, Excel or Matlab) to graph the data as v2 (vertical axis) versus d (horizontal axis). The equation that you derived in part (b) should show that v2 is a quadratic function of d, so, in your graph, fit the data by a second-order polynomial (quadratic) and have the graphing program display the equation for this trendline. Use that equation to find the block’s maximum speed v and the value of d at which this speed occurs. (d) By comparing the equation from the graphing program to the formula you derived in part (b), calculate the force constant k for the spring and the coefficient of kinetic friction for the friction force that the surface exerts on the block.

Q8.20 A woman stands in the middle of a perfectly smooth, frictionless, frozen lake. She can set herself in motion by throwing things, but suppose she has nothing to throw. Can she propel herself to shore without throwing anything?
i am afraid not. without external forces on a frictionless place she would be stuck forever

Q8.21 At the highest point in its parabolic trajectory, a shell explodes into two fragments. Is it possible for both fragments to fall straight down after the explosion? Why or why not?
well, no, since the words "explosion" suggests that some force was applied between the two fragments, so they cannot fall the exact same way.

Q8.22 When an object breaks into two pieces (explosion, radioactive decay, recoil, etc.), the lighter fragment gets more kinetic energy than the heavier one. This is a consequence of momentum conservation, but can you also explain it by using Newton’s laws of motion?
according to the third law, objects always exert same force upon each other after an interaction. this force can give more kinetic energy to the lighter fragment even though the force applied are the same because kinetic energy is calculated with $0.5*m*v^2$ and the lighter fragment has more velocity due to smaller mass

(a) Only its momentum is conserved; (b) only its total mechanical energy is conserved; (c) both its momentum and its total mechanical energy are conserved; (d) its kinetic energy is conserved.
the momentum of the apple is not conserved because its velocity changes, along with its kinetic energy. total mechanical energy is conserved because there are no external forces other than gravity, which is a conservative force.
