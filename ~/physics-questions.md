Q4.1 Can an object be in equilibrium when only one force acts on it? Explain.
this needs the vector sum of all the forces on the object to be zero, so if only one force acts upon it, then it is not i equilibrium.

Q4.2 A ball thrown straight up has zero velocity at its highest point. Is the ball in equilibrium at this point? Why or why not?
this needs the vector sum of all the forces on the object to be zero, so if only gravity acts upon it, then it is not i equilibrium.

Q4.3 A helium balloon hovers in midair, neither ascending nor descending. Is it in equilibrium? What forces act on it?
this needs the vector sum of all the forces on the object to be zero. there's the lift provided by the hot air and the pull of gravity, which are the same, so it is in equilibrium.

Q4.4 When you fly in an airplane at night in smooth air, you have no sensation of motion, even though the plane may be moving at 800 km>h. Why?
the plane is a closed environment with constant acceleration. everything in the closed environment has the same acceleration so you have no sensation of motion. however, when the plane's acceleration changes, your inertia causes you to resist changes in acceleration, so you get pressed back to your seat.

Q4.5 If the two ends of a rope in equilibrium are pulled with forces of equal magnitude and opposite directions, why isn’t the total tension in the rope zero?
although the acceleration of the rope is zero, tension is how much the rope is

Q4.6 You tie a brick to the end of a rope and whirl the brick around you in a horizontal circle. Describe the path of the brick after you suddenly let go of the rope.
without the tension of the rope the brick would accelerate towards the direction of the rope when it was released.

Q4.7 When a car stops suddenly, the passengers tend to move forward relative to their seats. Why? When a car makes a sharp turn, the passengers tend to slide to one side of the car. Why?
inertia; see Q4.4

Q4.8 Some people say that the “force of inertia” (or “force of momentum”) throws the passengers forward when a car brakes sharply. What is wrong with this explanation?
the change in acceleration causes this, not inertia.

Q4.9 A passenger in a moving bus with no windows notices that a ball that has been at rest in the aisle suddenly starts to move toward the rear of the bus. Think of two possible explanations, and devise a way to decide which is correct.
the bus is moving uphill and ball is pulled by gravity
the bus acceleration changes so that ball moves

Q4.10 Suppose you chose the fundamental physical quantities to be force, length, and time instead of mass, length, and time. What would be the units of mass in terms of those fundamental quantities?
newtons

Q4.11 Why is the earth only approximately an inertial reference frame? Q4.12 Does Newton’s second law hold true for an observer in a van as it speeds up, slows down, or rounds a corner? Explain.

Q4.22 A large crate is suspended from the end of a vertical rope. Is the tension in the rope greater when the crate is at rest or when it is moving upward at constant speed? If the crate is traveling upward, is the tension in the rope greater when the crate is speeding up or when it is slowing down? In each case, explain in terms of Newton’s laws of motion. Q4.23 Which feels a greater pull due to the earth’s gravity: a 10 kg stone or a 20 kg stone? If you drop the two stones, why doesn’t the 20 kg stone fall with twice the acceleration of the 10 kg stone? Explain. Q4.24 A horse is hitched to a wagon. Since the wagon pulls back on the horse just as hard as the horse pulls on the wagon, why doesn’t the wagon remain in equilibrium, no matter how hard the horse pulls? Q4.25 True or false? You exert a push P on an object and it pushes back on you with a force F. If the object is moving at constant velocity, then F is equal to P, but if the object is being accelerated, then P must be greater than F.

Q4.13 Some students refer to the quantity maS as “the force of acceleration.” Is it correct to refer to this quantity as a force? If so, what exerts this force? If not, what is a better description of this quantity?
Q4.14 The acceleration of a falling object is measured in a lift that is traveling upward at a constant speed of 9.8 m>s. What value is obtained? Q4.15 You can play catch with a softball in a bus moving with constant speed on a straight road, just as though the bus were at rest. Is this still possible when the bus is making a turn at constant speed on a level road? Why or why not?

### exercises 4

Q4.17 Why can it hurt your foot more to kick a big rock than a small pebble? Must the big rock hurt more? Explain.
Bid rocks have more mass and therefore a greater amount of force is needed to accelerate it.

Q4.18 “It’s not the fall that hurts you; it’s the sudden stop at the bottom.” Translate this saying into the language of Newton’s laws of motion.

(b) If you hold a 3.65-kg package by a light vertical string, what will be the tension in this string when the lift accelerates as in part (a)?

you are pressing with a force of 665N to the elevator because of gravity, and the elevator exerts normal force of 655N on you too.

Q8.8 In Example 8.7 (Section 8.3), where the two gliders of Fig. 8.18 stick together after the collision, the collision is inelastic because K2 6 K1. In Example 8.5 (Section 8.2), is the collision inelastic? Explain.

Q8.9 In a completely inelastic collision between two objects, where the objects stick together after the collision, is it possible for the final kinetic energy of the system to be zero? If so, give an example in which this would occur. If the final kinetic energy is zero, what must the initial momentum of the system be? Is the initial kinetic energy of the system zero? Explain.

Q8.14 A machine gun is fired at a steel plate. Is the average force on the plate from the bullet impact greater if the bullets bounce off or if they are squashed and stick to the plate? Explain.
Force exerted onto the plate would be more if the bullets didn't bounce off; energy in the system is constant and bouncing uses energy.

Q8.15 A net external force of 4 N acts on an object initially at rest for 0.25 s and gives it a final speed of 5 m>s. How could a net external force of 2 N produce the same final speed?
the force would need to act on the object for 0.5 s

Q8.17 A tennis player hits a tennis ball with a racket. Consider the system made up of the ball and the racket. Is the total momentum of the system the same just before and just after the hit?

Q8.20 A woman stands in the middle of a perfectly smooth, frictionless, frozen lake. She can set herself in motion by throwing things, but suppose she has nothing to throw. Can she propel herself to shore without throwing anything?
i am afraid not. without external forces on a frictionless place she would be stuck forever

Q8.21 At the highest point in its parabolic trajectory, a shell explodes into two fragments. Is it possible for both fragments to fall straight down after the explosion? Why or why not?
well, no, since the words "explosion" suggests that some force was applied between the two fragments, so they cannot fall the exact same way.

Q8.22 When an object breaks into two pieces (explosion, radioactive decay, recoil, etc.), the lighter fragment gets more kinetic energy than the heavier one. This is a consequence of momentum conservation, but can you also explain it by using Newton’s laws of motion?
according to the third law, objects always exert same force upon each other after an interaction. this force can give more kinetic energy to the lighter fragment even though the force applied are the same because kinetic energy is calculated with $0.5*m*v^2$ and the lighter fragment has more velocity due to smaller mass

Q8.23 An apple falls from a tree and feels no air resistance. As it is falling, which of these statements about it are true? (a) Only its momentum is conserved; (b) only its total mechanical energy is conserved; (c) both its momentum and its total mechanical energy are conserved; (d) its kinetic energy is conserved.
the momentum of the apple is not conserved because its velocity changes, along with its kinetic energy. total mechanical energy is conserved because there are no external forces other than gravity, which is a conservative force.
