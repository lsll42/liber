Q4.1 Can an object be in equilibrium when only one force acts on it? Explain.
this needs the vector sum of all the forces on the object to be zero, so if only one force acts upon it, then it is not i equilibrium.

Q4.2 A ball thrown straight up has zero velocity at its highest point. Is the ball in equilibrium at this point? Why or why not?
this needs the vector sum of all the forces on the object to be zero, so if only gravity acts upon it, then it is not i equilibrium.

Q4.3 A helium balloon hovers in midair, neither ascending nor descending. Is it in equilibrium? What forces act on it?
this needs the vector sum of all the forces on the object to be zero. there's the lift provided by the hot air and the pull of gravity, which are the same, so it is in equilibrium.

Q4.4 When you fly in an airplane at night in smooth air, you have no sensation of motion, even though the plane may be moving at 800 km>h. Why?
the plane is a closed environment with constant acceleration. everything in the closed environment has the same acceleration so you have no sensation of motion. however, when the plane's acceleration changes, your inertia causes you to resist changes in acceleration, so you get pressed back to your seat.

Q4.5 If the two ends of a rope in equilibrium are pulled with forces of equal magnitude and opposite directions, why isn’t the total tension in the rope zero?
although the acceleration of the rope is zero, tension is how much the rope is

Q4.6 You tie a brick to the end of a rope and whirl the brick around you in a horizontal circle. Describe the path of the brick after you suddenly let go of the rope.
without the tension of the rope the brick would accelerate towards the direction of the rope when it was released.

Q4.7 When a car stops suddenly, the passengers tend to move forward relative to their seats. Why? When a car makes a sharp turn, the passengers tend to slide to one side of the car. Why?
inertia; see Q4.4

Q4.8 Some people say that the “force of inertia” (or “force of momentum”) throws the passengers forward when a car brakes sharply. What is wrong with this explanation?
the change in acceleration causes this, not inertia.

Q4.9 A passenger in a moving bus with no windows notices that a ball that has been at rest in the aisle suddenly starts to move toward the rear of the bus. Think of two possible explanations, and devise a way to decide which is correct.
the bus is moving uphill and ball is pulled by gravity
the bus acceleration changes so that ball moves

Q4.10 Suppose you chose the fundamental physical quantities to be force, length, and time instead of mass, length, and time. What would be the units of mass in terms of those fundamental quantities?
newtons

Q4.11 Why is the earth only approximately an inertial reference frame? Q4.12 Does Newton’s second law hold true for an observer in a van as it speeds up, slows down, or rounds a corner? Explain.

Q4.22 A large crate is suspended from the end of a vertical rope. Is the tension in the rope greater when the crate is at rest or when it is moving upward at constant speed? If the crate is traveling upward, is the tension in the rope greater when the crate is speeding up or when it is slowing down? In each case, explain in terms of Newton’s laws of motion. Q4.23 Which feels a greater pull due to the earth’s gravity: a 10 kg stone or a 20 kg stone? If you drop the two stones, why doesn’t the 20 kg stone fall with twice the acceleration of the 10 kg stone? Explain. Q4.24 A horse is hitched to a wagon. Since the wagon pulls back on the horse just as hard as the horse pulls on the wagon, why doesn’t the wagon remain in equilibrium, no matter how hard the horse pulls? Q4.25 True or false? You exert a push P on an object and it pushes back on you with a force F. If the object is moving at constant velocity, then F is equal to P, but if the object is being accelerated, then P must be greater than F.

Q4.26 A large truck and a small compact car have a head-on collision. During the collision, the truck exerts a force FS on the car, and the

Q4.13 Some students refer to the quantity maS as “the force of acceleration.” Is it correct to refer to this quantity as a force? If so, what exerts this force? If not, what is a better description of this quantity?
Q4.14 The acceleration of a falling object is measured in a lift that is traveling upward at a constant speed of 9.8 m>s. What value is obtained? Q4.15 You can play catch with a softball in a bus moving with constant speed on a straight road, just as though the bus were at rest. Is this still possible when the bus is making a turn at constant speed on a level road? Why or why not?

S T on C
car exerts a force FC on T on the truck. Which force has the larger magnitude, or are they the same? Does your answer depend on how fast each vehicle was moving before the collision? Why or why not?
Q4.27 When a car comes to a stop on a level road, what force causes it to slow down? When the car increases its speed on the same road, what force causes it to speed up? Explain.
Q4.28 A small compact car is pushing a large van that has broken down, and they travel along the road with equal velocities and accelerations. While the car is speeding up, is the force it exerts on the van larger than, smaller than, or the same magnitude as the force the van exerts on it? Which vehicle has the larger net force on it, or are the net forces the same? Explain.
Q4.29 Consider a tug-of-war between two people who pull in opposite directions on the ends of a rope. By Newton’s third law, the force that A exerts on B is just as great as the force that B exerts on A. So what determines who wins? (Hint: Draw a free-body diagram showing all the forces that act on each person.)
Q4.30 Boxes A and B are in contact
on a horizontal, frictionless surface.
You push on box A with a horizon-
tal 100 N force (Fig. Q4.31). Box A
weighs 150 N, and box B weighs 50
N. Is the force that box A exerts on
box B equal to 100 N, greater than 100 N, or less than 100 N? Explain. Q4.31 A manual for student pilots contains this passage: “When an airplane flies at a steady altitude, neither climbing nor descending, the upward lift force from the wings equals the plane’s weight. When the plane is climbing at a steady rate, the upward lift is greater than the weight; when the plane is descending at a steady rate, the upward lift is less than the weight.” Are these statements correct? Explain.
Q4.32 If your hands are wet and no towel is handy, you can remove some of the excess water by shaking them. Why does this work?
Q4.33 If you squat down (such as when you examine the books on a bottom shelf) and then suddenly get up, you may temporarily feel light-headed. What do Newton’s laws of motion have to say about why this happens? Q4.34 When a car is hit from behind, the occupants may experience whiplash. Use Newton’s laws of motion to explain what causes this result. Q4.35 In a head-on auto collision, passengers who are not wearing seat belts may be thrown through the windshield. Use Newton’s laws of motion to explain why this happens.

Q4.17 Why can it hurt your foot more to kick a big rock than a small pebble? Must the big rock hurt more? Explain.
Bid rocks have more mass and therefore a greater amount of force is needed to accelerate it.

Q4.18 “It’s not the fall that hurts you; it’s the sudden stop at the bottom.” Translate this saying into the language of Newton’s laws of motion.
Q4.19 A person can dive into water from a height of 10 m without injury, but a person who jumps off the roof of a 10-m-tall building and lands on a concrete street is likely to be seriously injured. Why is there a difference?
Q4.20 Why are cars designed to crumple in front and back for safety? Why not for side collisions and rollovers?

(b) If you hold a 3.65-kg package by a light vertical string, what will be the tension in this string when the lift accelerates as in part (a)?

you are pressing with a force of 665N to the elevator because of gravity, and the elevator exerts normal force of 655N on you too.

4.9 • A box rests on a frozen pond, which serves as a frictionless horizontal surface. If a fisherman applies a horizontal force with magnitude 50.0 N to the box and produces an acceleration of magnitude 3.60 m>s , what is the mass of the box?
