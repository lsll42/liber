# math-polynomial

a polynomial is an equation that has at least one of the two variables to the power of 2 or more.
examples include:

$$
y=x^2
$$

$$
y=x^2+1
$$

$$
y=(x-1)^2+1
$$

the above equations are all *binomials ​*because the highest power the terms have is 2.
not to be confused with *trinomial*, which means any equation that has three terms.

here is an example of an equation that is a binomial and a trinomial:

$$
y=x^2+2x+6
$$

*trinomials* like this take the following form:

$$
y=ax^2+bx+c
$$

where a, b, c are constants.

the equation above can be factored into this format:

$$
y=(x+j)(x+k)
$$

where j, k are constants as well, and the following equations tell us how to get them:

$$
j\times k = a\times c
$$

$$
j+k=b
$$

## vertex form

$$
y=(x-h)^2+k
$$

where (h,k) represents the coordinates of the equation's *vertex*.
