# physics-variables

### units

> abbreviations of units are case sensitive

s  second

m  meter

kg  kilogram

N  newton

> okay, now that we know what abbreviations we use for the units, moving on to physics variables definitions

### constants

$G$  gravitational constant  N*m^2/kg^2  6.67*10^-11

‍

### variables

$\Delta d$  displacement  m  how much an object is displaced

$v$  velocity  m/s  displacement over time, a measure of how fast displacement occurs

$a$  acceleration  m/s/s  velocity over time, a measure of how fast velocity changes

$F$  force  N  measures influence over an object's acceleration.

$m$  mass  kg  resistance to change in acceleration of the object when responding to forces

$p$  momentum*​  ​*kg*m/s*​  ​*the product of the mass and velocity of an object.

‍

$r$  distance between two objects  m

$g$  gravitational field strength  m/s/s N/kg

$F_G$  force that applys to object due to gravity  N

$U_G$  gravitational potential energy  J  potential energy due to gravity

#### springs

$U_S$  elastic potential energy  J  potential energy due to displacement from equilibrium

$k$  spring constant

#### angular momentum

$L$  angular momentum  kg*m/s  the momentum of an object about a specified axis

$r_\perp$  perpendicular distance from axis to the object's line of motion  m

‍

#### harmonic motion

$A$  amplitude  m  maximum magnitude of displacement away from origin

$T$  period  s  amount of time needed to complete one cycle

$f$  frequency  Hz  measures number of occurrences of a repeating event per

##### pendulum

$L$  length  m  measure of how long the string of the pendulum is

##### waves

$\lambda$  wavelength  m  measure how long each wave is

$v$  wave velocity  m/s  velocity to measure how fast the waves travel
