# physics-laws

## these laws are always to be obeyed in physics

​#energy#​

​#law#​ of conservation of energy: the total energy of an isolated system is constant. energy is neither created nor destroyed, it can only be transformed from one form to another or transferred from one system to another.

‍

​#momentumforce#​

​#law#​ of conservation of momentum: the momentum of a system is constant if no external forces are acting on the system.

‍

‍

#work #force​

​#law#​ the change in mechanical energy of a system is equal to the total work done on the system by all nonconservative forces.
