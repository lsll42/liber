# writing-scrapbook-notes-body-paragraphs

Body paragraphs are the 'content' of your essay – after introducing your ideas, this is your chance to go into detail, draw on evidence from the text, and discuss Randa Abdel-Fattah's authorial intent.

When writing body paragraphs, you may have learnt the 'TEEL' structure in the past. At Year 9 level, think of TEEL as a 'tool' - it is there to help you organise your ideas, but not the most important part of your essay. Your body paragraph should have:

* A topic sentence at the start - a sentence that conveys an insight into the prompt, and gives your reader a clear sense of the argument in this paragraph. You should use the author's name here, but you should avoid using specific details like character names, quotes, or evidence – save it for later!

* A linking sentence at the end – this is where you tie your discussion back to your contention and the key words in the essay prompt, proving that you are staying 'on topic'.

* In between these two sentences, your discussion should have at least 4-6 more sentences. This is where you elaborate on your ideas, use evidence to prove your points, discuss authorial intent and literary devices, and discuss some of your ideas in more detail. Do NOT just do 'one sentence of explanation and one sentence of evidence' at Year 9 level!

Previously, we have looked at the essay prompt:

Randa Abdel-Fattah suggests that it is important to question stereotypes. To what extent do you agree?

Here are examples of three topic sentences that a student might use to structure their discussion of this prompt:

* Paragraph 1: Randa Abdel-Fattah sympathises with people who easily accept stereotypes, suggesting that they are victims of their surroundings.

 * Hint: think Michael and his family, Mina's first impressions of Michael,

* Paragraph 2: Characters who reinforce or spread stereotypes are depicted in a critical light, reflecting Abdel-Fattah's strong message about the negative influence of stereotypes.

 * Hint: think Terrence, Alan, Aussie Values, the media at Kabul Kitchen

* Paragraph 3: Abdel-Fattah suggests that when characters question stereotypes, they are able to develop a more informed view of society.

 * Hint: think Michael's character development across the text

Your task for today is to take these topic sentences, and turn them into full body paragraphs. Aim for 6-8 sentences in each paragraph, which should include:

* Evidence in the form of embedded quotes and literary devices (like metaphors, symbolism, imagery, intertextuality, irony)

* Discussion of authorial intent (hint: we can do this by making Randa Abdel-Fattah the subject of our sentences)

* A linking sentence at the end, which ties back to the essay prompt
