# physics-momentum-and-impulse

## momentum - mass - velocity - impulse - net external force - time

### momentum - mass - velocity

$$
p=mv
$$

*p ​*is momentum

*m* is mass of object

*v* is velocity of object

‍

### impulse - net external force - time

$$
\Delta p = F_{net} \Delta t
$$

$\Delta p$ is impulse = change in momentum

$F_{net}$ is the net external force

$\Delta t$ is the time over which $F_{net}$ acts

‍

## elastic collisions and transfer of momentum

remember the law of conservation of momentum? this means that for a given elastic collision between a system of object, the amount of momentum is the same before and after the collision.
