continuity: continuity over a point means that for a function $f(x)$, it is continuous at point $x=c$ if $\lim \limits_{x\to c} = f(c)$. continuity over an interval means the state of having defined outputs for every value in the target input interval. <u>intuitively, a function is continuous over an interval if you can draw the graph of the function over that interval using a single line without lifting your pen</u>

discontinuity: opposite of continuity

approach: for a function $f(x)$, when we want the value of the output as $x$ approaches 1, we make $x$ increasing closer to 1 but never equal to 1, and see what value the output is getting closer to, which can be described as the value of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches 1.

one sided limit: for a function $f(x)$, the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches a constant from the left hand side is called the left hand one-sided limit, depicted as $\lim \limits_{x \to c-}f(x)$, where c is a constant; the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches a constant from the right hand side is called the right hand one-sided limit, depicted as $\lim \limits_{x \to c+}f(x)$

bidirectional limits: when we talk about a limit, it, by default, means a bidirectional limit, which exists if it has the left hand one-sided limit and right hand one-sided limit. if not, then the bidirectional limit does not exist. to represent, if $\lim \limits_{x \to c-}f(x) = \lim \limits_{x \to c+}f(x) = 1$, then $\lim \limits_{x \to c}f(x) = 1$
