# physics-relativity

the theory of relativity is based on two postulates:
- the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference
- the speed of light in vacuum is the same in all inertial frames

the implication of this are:
- events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be simultaneous for another.
  when two observers moving relative to each other measure a time interval or a length, they may not get the same re-sults
- for the conservation principles for momentum and energy to be valid in all in- ertial systems, Newtonâ€™s second law and the equations for momentum and kinetic energy have to be revised

this means that it is impossible for an inertial observer to travel at the speed of light, c.
