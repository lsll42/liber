**Introduction to Fluids:**

   - Fluids are substances that flow and take the shape of their container.
   - Two types: liquids (incompressible) and gases (compressible).


**Properties of Fluids:**

   - Density: Mass per unit volume. Determines how heavy a fluid is.
   - Viscosity: Resistance to flow. High viscosity = thicker fluid.


**Pressure in Fluids:**

   - Pressure = Force per unit area. P = F/A.
   - Pascal's Law: Pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished.


**Buoyancy and Archimedes' Principle:**

   - Buoyant force: Upward force on an object in a fluid. Equal to weight of displaced fluid.
   - Archimedes' Principle: An object immersed in a fluid experiences an upward force = weight of fluid displaced.


**Fluid Flow:**

   - Types of Flow: Laminar (smooth) and Turbulent (chaotic).
   - Reynolds Number: Determines flow characteristics. High Re = turbulent flow.


**Bernoulli's Principle:**

   - Describes relationship between fluid speed and pressure.
   - Increased speed = decreased pressure and vice versa along streamline.


**Applications of Bernoulli's Principle:**

   - Airplane wings, carburetors, atomizers, etc., utilize Bernoulli's principle.
   - Venturi Effect: Decrease in pressure in a constricted flow area.


**Fluid Dynamics:**

   - Continuity Equation: A1V1 = A2V2 for incompressible fluids in steady flow.
   - Bernoulli's Equation: P + 0.5ρv² + ρgh = constant along streamline.


**Applications of Fluid Dynamics:**

   - Blood flow in arteries, water flow in pipes, weather patterns, etc.
   - Understanding fluid dynamics aids in designing efficient systems.


**Challenges and Future Developments:**

   - Fluid dynamics simulations for complex systems.
   - Improving understanding of turbulence and chaotic flow.

Fluid physics provides the foundation for understanding how liquids and gases behave, encompassing properties like pressure, flow, and buoyancy. From Archimedes' Principle to Bernoulli's Equation, these principles find applications in diverse fields, from aviation to medicine. Advancements in fluid dynamics continue to unravel complexities and improve systems across various industries.

Basically, i would have to type some things in here for the time being, i hope you understand.

the thing is, this obsidian vault gets automatically published to github every 20 minutes so this isn't the best place to write stuff that i don't want published...

but it should be alright as long as i be careful and not accidentally paste anything into here haha

anyways, i thought that i should write in my journal more often but sometimes i forget :/
writing in my journal is one of the most important things to me, 

when you look into a physics book and find all those concepts that seem absolutely daunting, you get really tempted to just give up and do something else. "why would you ever use thing kinda stuff?" you ask yourself. uhh, yes, there is a very small chance that self-learning some things in advance could help you with your education stuff later into high school, but you don't have to force yourself. find out what you're interested in, and try to make most out of being forced to self-learn things in advance. have you ever wondered how something works? do research into that topic for hours and hours, slap the stamp on, and call it a successful day of self-learning something that you are interested about. one such example would be to spend weeks and weeks on researching the information about explosions, and write 5 papers on the chemical reaction and compound choices... just joking, but you get the idea - something that you would like to know about is worth doing, no matter how hard it might be.

when times get difficult and you have to study furiously about hard to digest stuff, try to get the most out of it but good luck...

when you feel detached from the world, dfiting through the sky without any particular meaning or purpose, you feel that horrible feeling that you are in fact all alone in the world. "why must it be like this?", you think, "why is it just me who feels this way?" this is okay. everything is fine. think about what matters the most to you - 


Also, the magnetic fields could
