elastic collision: A collision between bodies in which the total and kinetic energy of the bodies is conserved. This means there is no thermal energy, sound energy, and material deformation (these would require energy)

inelastic collision: A collision between bodies in which the colliding particles stick together. While momentum of the system is conserved in an  inelastic collision, kinetic energy is not. This is because some kinetic  energy had been transferred to something else. Thermal energy, sound energy, and material deformation are likely culprits.
