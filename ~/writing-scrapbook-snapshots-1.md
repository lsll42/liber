Abdel-Fattah underlines the importance of empathy through Michael's developing
relationship with Mina. When Michael first meets Mina at the protest, he is interested in
her, but holds his family's limited perspective of "queue-jumpers". As their relationship
develops, Michael begins to grow and question these beliefs, seeing Mina and other
refugees as people, rather than the stereotypes his family had suggested. Michael's
observation that he "feels like a tourist" when he visits Western Sydney emphasises the
growth in Michael's character and perception of those around him; AbdeI-Fattah presents
Michael as an outsider in the multicultural community in order to demonstrate how he is
becoming more aware of the diverse experiences of modern Australians. In fact, Michael
"feels like an idiot" when he instinctively tenses as a group of men speaking Arabic pass
him and his brother, reflecting how Michael's newfound ability to empathise with the
experience of others has led him to become more aware of his own biases, too.
Ultimately, Michael's belief that Mina "turned [his] life inside out and nothing's been the
same since" highlights the significant impact of empathy on his perspective of the world—
around him, which he goes on to apply to his relationships with his parents and Terrence.
