# writing-work-speech-AI-regulation

I stand here today, to warn you about the dangers of AI and to ask you to  sign this petition to regulate AI development.

I used to work as a professional photographer, capturing beautiful moments and creating art through my lens.

It was a job that I was passionate about, and I poured my heart and soul into every project. However, with the rise of AI, my world was turned upside down: companies started using AI to generate stunning images with just a few clicks.

Suddenly, the artistry and craftsmanship that I brought to my work seemed less valuable… clients began opting for cheaper and faster AI solutions. The feeling of being replaced by algorithms and losing the career that defined me was devastating! It's not just losing a job. it's losing the passion that fueled my creativity.

The use of AI in generating works of art, music and written works raises significant concerns for copyright law and greatly impacts all of us. It's not just copyright; AI systems usually access large amounts of sensitive information and raise a great amount of security issues. In August, zoom changed its terms of service to allow AI to see your video calls. These calls to your friends and family are being fed to those mindless generators right now!

Also, AI is developing in an uncontrollable way. What you've seen is just the tip of the iceberg.

large companies are feeding everything they have into AI, and the consequences of uncontrollable AI can be disastrous for our privacy and our national security! Back in March, Google announced that their AI was trained with over 1 trillion words on the internet; this number has grown to 3 trillion words and will only increase until all of human knowledge gets consumed by this black hole.

Furthermore, AI is taking over the internet. News Corp uses AI to produce more than 3000 Australian local news articles per week! This irresponsible use of unreliable content generators poisons online information and cannot be accepted.
  

The whirlpool is growing, the tides are turning, an invisible storm is brewing! We cannot let AI take over our jobs, and we certainly cannot let AI take over our internet. Please support my cause by signing this petition to regulate AI development. Will we allow AI to become uncontrollable? It is up to you.
