# today we have... 20231025155939

**Forwarded from [sublimeclemency ðŸŽ„](https://t.me/sublimeclemency)**

today we have the first aloft weekly meeting.
i thought maybe could be at 6pm and moutamn was like sure, i am free at any time even though he "does lots of important stuff at home"

so i guess he might be expected to show up in google meet.

nobody could refuse how colab is the missing thing in our lives...

the lemon flavoured and apple flavoured lollies i just bought are relatively expensive but spectacular.

yes, that bus with a route i have never seen went past me. the bus i was waiitng for in the past 20 minutes is comi mg soon.
