i saw a postman today.
not everyday you get to see a postman

petroleum smells so bad

two of the people my this bus right now look... immersed in their realities which are a little unimportant or chaotic, just saying.

getting home 45 minutes later than usual today cause i shelved so many books which were so very hard and confusing uhh

wednesdays are different.
i get home later so that i can meet more people, people whom i haven't seen before.

i'd say that it's partially worth it to waste my time sitting in this bus that hasn't moved in the last 3 minutes watching two guys hold their bus card with their teeth and listening to weird gossip.

i need new music, really. i usually listen to the same songs and i definitely need a change

i shall download 100000 pieces of lyrics from an online dataset

hope they would be actual nice lyrics instead of bad ones :/

...

i lack motivation to program these days
