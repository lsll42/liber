# freedom

To be free is to be an eagle soaring through the clouds,

To be free is to be unchallenged and respected,

To be free is to be a tumbleweed rolling across the desert,

To be free is to be a honored guest anywhere,

To be free is to have no home but to roam where you wish,

To be free is to have no one claim you as their own,

To be free is to be enjoy life as it comes without worries,

To be free is to be who you where meant to be.
