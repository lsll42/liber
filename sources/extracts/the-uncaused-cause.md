# the-uncaused-cause
~ a short writing by unknowner

It can be assumed that it came out of nothing. Mostly because its cause was unknown but also because in order to escape the paradox of creation and cause, something must have. It was the Uncaused Cause, a thing, an entity or just a form just a little more complex than nothingness. It would be known by different names in different bubbles caused by it's ripples. As it's ripples would spread across different bubbles they would cause variety among the bubbles, differentiating them with numbers and forms of - the most suitable and understandable word would be - dimensions, but no word can be used for them without loosing complete originality of the idea. 

Anyway in some entities, formed by the effects of the Uncaused Cause, it would be known by the name God - a sentient being which was deliberately involved in the making of the universe they're living in, while in some others it would be knows by a very small fluctuation on some subatomic scale which caused the big bang, again responsible for the creation of their universe, however unintentionally this time, and probably unknowingly. 

Another form of it's existence would be imagined as the first superposition that the very first quark happened to be in, whether willingly or as the uncaused cause because the quark itself was the Uncaused Cause. 

Doesn't matter whichever form its existence would be thought and believed in, its existence would make its appearance to everyone at least once. Whether it would be by making some of the entities formed by its effects think, write and spread about what exactly it was. Or astraying them by making them think, write and spread about what it wasn't.

It would bring chaos and beauty along with it's ripples equally. Chaos as a price for beauty and beauty as a compensation for chaos. By all means whatever melodies it would choose its ripples would spread out forevermore. As a song which would be audible to every ear, every heart and soul, loud and clear. 

And now you, you are also a witness of it. The witness of the uncaused cause. Now you will also spread out it's ripples, sing its song just like the one who sung for you.
