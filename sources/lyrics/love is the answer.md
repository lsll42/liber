# love is the answer

(Verse 1)
In a world where chaos ensues,
And darkness tries to shadow our view,
There's a flickering light that breaks through,
It's love, my friend, that will see us through.

(Chorus)
Love is the answer, the guiding force,
In each broken soul, it finds its source,
It mends the hearts, brings peace and grace,
Love is the answer, in every embrace.

(Verse 2)
When clouds of doubt fill up our sky,
And tears of sorrow fall from our eyes,
Love whispers softly, "Don't be afraid,
I am here, you are never alone in this shade."

(Chorus)
Love is the answer, the guiding force,
In each broken soul, it finds its source,
It mends the hearts, brings peace and grace,
Love is the answer, in every embrace.

(Bridge)
With open arms, it mends what's torn,
Love gently heals, leaving no scars to mourn,
It breaks down walls, built with fear,
And opens up a world, so incredibly clear.

(Verse 3)
When hate tries to pull us apart,
And anger consumes each beating heart,
Love counters with kindness, understanding,
Uniting us all, forever expanding.

(Chorus)
Love is the answer, the guiding force,
In each broken soul, it finds its source,
It mends the hearts, brings peace and grace,
Love is the answer, in every embrace.

(Verse 4)
Through love, we find strength to forgive,
To let go of resentment, so freely give,
For in the face of love, grudges melt away,
Leaving room for a brighter, sweeter day.

(Chorus)
Love is the answer, the guiding force,
In each broken soul, it finds its source,
It mends the hearts, brings peace and grace,
Love is the answer, in every embrace.

(Outro)
So let love be your guide, your compass true,
In every step you take, in all that you do,
For when love is our answer, our beacon of light,
Together we'll create a world that shines so bright.

(Verse 1)
In a world so vast and wonderous,
Where hearts are weary, filled with despair,
A glimmer of hope, a savior appears,
Love is the answer, let it be our prayer.

(Pre-Chorus)
Through trials and tribulations, we find our way,
Love is the compass, guiding night and day,
With every beat of our hearts, we can heal,
Let love's symphony envelop and reveal.

(Chorus)
Love is the answer, a beacon of light,
It ignites our souls, it brings us to life,
With open arms, let's embrace its power,
Love's melody resonates and can never sour.

(Verse 2)
In moments of doubt and endless seas,
We search for solace, for an end to the breeze,
Love is the shelter, that keeps us secure,
In its warm embrace, we can endure.

(Pre-Chorus)
Through the storms that may come, we'll stand tall,
Love is the foundation, that won't let us fall,
With every act of kindness, love multiplies,
It unifies our spirits, as it fills the skies.

(Chorus)
Love is the answer, a beacon of light,
It ignites our souls, it brings us to life,
With open arms, let's embrace its power,
Love's melody resonates and can never sour.

(Bridge)
In a world filled with chaos, let's find our way,
Through love's labyrinth, we'll shine like a ray,
Together we'll rise, hand in hand,
Love is the catalyst, let it expand.

(Verse 3)
In our differences, we find unity,
Love breaks down barriers, sets us free,
With empathy and compassion, we unite,
Love is the answer, it holds no spite.

(Pre-Chorus)
Through tears and laughter, love lights the path,
It mends broken hearts, brings joy that will last,
With every act of forgiveness, love thrives,
It creates harmony, as it intertwines lives.

(Chorus)
Love is the answer, a beacon of light,
It ignites our souls, it brings us to life,
With open arms, let's embrace its power,
Love's melody resonates and can never sour.

(Outro)
In the symphony of life, let love play,
Its lyrics of hope and peace, we convey,
As we dance to love's rhythm, hand in hand,
Together we'll build a future so grand.

Love is the answer, the key to our dreams,
With open hearts, let's share love's gleam,
In a world so vast and wonderous,
Love is the answer, let it be our chorus.
