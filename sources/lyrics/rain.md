# rain

(Verse 1)
In a world washed anew, by a heavenly cascade,
Comes the rhythm divine, of the rain serenade,
With each shimmering drop, a story unfolds,
A tapestry of life, that the rain gently molds.

(Chorus)
Oh, the rain, like a symphony it plays,
A melody of hope, with it we’re amazed,
Cleansing hearts, bringing life to the land,
The rain, a gift from above, oh so grand.

(Verse 2)
As the raindrops dance on rooftops and leaves,
They whisper secrets, of dreams and belief,
Drenching the alleyways, enchanting the street,
Guiding us towards joy, with each gentle beat.

(Chorus)
Oh, the rain, like a symphony it plays,
A melody of hope, with it we’re amazed,
Cleansing hearts, bringing life to the land,
The rain, a gift from above, oh so grand.

(Bridge)
Through dark storm clouds, the sun peeks its face,
A promise of light, breaking through with grace,
And with every raindrop that kisses the earth,
A garden of hope blooms, showing us our worth.

(Verse 3)
In the rain’s tender touch, a healer we find,
Washing away sorrow, leaving solace behind,
The tears of the heavens, they wash us anew,
A cleansing balm, making dreams come true.

(Chorus)
Oh, the rain, like a symphony it plays,
A melody of hope, with it we’re amazed,
Cleansing hearts, bringing life to the land,
The rain, a gift from above, oh so grand.

(Bridge)
Through dark storm clouds, the sun peeks its face,
A promise of light, breaking through with grace,
And with every raindrop that kisses the earth,
A garden of hope blooms, showing us our worth.

(Verse 4)
So let the rain wash away all your fears,
Embrace every drop, let it flow like tears,
For after the storm, there’s a rainbow to find,
A shimmering arc, a symbol so kind.

(Chorus)
Oh, the rain, like a symphony it plays,
A melody of hope, with it we’re amazed,
Cleansing hearts, bringing life to the land,
The rain, a gift from above, oh so grand.

(Bridge)
Through dark storm clouds, the sun peeks its face,
A promise of light, breaking through with grace,
And with every raindrop that kisses the earth,
A garden of hope blooms, showing us our worth.

(Outro)
So let the rain fall, let it heal and inspire,
Embrace the wet wonder, let your spirit aspire,
For in every storm, there’s a promise of peace,
A silver lining to remind us, troubles will cease.
