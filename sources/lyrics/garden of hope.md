Verse 1:
Amidst the garden of hope, where dreams arise,
The fountains sing, reaching for the skies,
A symphony of faith, a vibrant tune,
Bathed in colors, beneath a radiant moon.

Oh, let us dance upon the water's spray,
Where hope blossoms, in the most vibrant display,
In this garden of dreams, we'll find our way,
As the fountains of life, guide us day by day.

The first fountain whispers of love's embrace,
Sprinkling tender drops upon our weary face,
It speaks of a love that knows no bounds,
Where communication transcends all sounds.

We find solace and our hearts set free,
The fountains of hope, they gently mend,
Souls that are broken, they help us transcend.

Spraying gleeful blessings, here and ever after,
It caresses our spirits, lighting our days,
Reminding us to bask in life's sunny rays.

Where hope blossoms, in the most vibrant display,
In this garden of dreams, we'll find our way,

Sending ripples of bravery, pushing back the night,
It empowers our hearts, when fear pulls us down,

To pursue our dreams, and fulfill our every need.

It imparts the secrets of the universe divine,
Enlightening our path, a beacon so sublime.
