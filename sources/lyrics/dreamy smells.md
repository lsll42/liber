# dreamy smells

(Verse 1)
As I walk through fields of lavender, my senses come alive
A dreamy scent of sweetness, a fragrance that will thrive
The sun kisses my skin with warmth, as gentle winds caress
A symphony of aromas, with each step I progress

(Chorus)
Dreamy smells fill the air, enchanting all around
A fragrance so opulent, it never will confound
In this scented world I'll roam, forever feeling blessed
Every breath a reminder, life's dreams are manifest

(Verse 2)
A whiff of freshly baked bread, drifting from afar
It wraps around my heart, like a comforting memoir
Memories of home, of laughter and delight
The aroma of togetherness, a sense of love in flight

(Chorus)
Dreamy smells fill the air, enchanting all around
A fragrance so opulent, it never will confound
In this scented world I'll roam, forever feeling blessed
Every breath a reminder, life's dreams are manifest

(Bridge)
In the garden of roses, petals brush my cheek
Their perfume dances on the breeze, this dream I'll always seek
The scent of love's promise, like a sweet and tender kiss
The whisper of forever, in each fragrant reminisce

(Verse 3)
Walking through a forest, beneath a canopy of pine
The earthy aroma fills my soul, transcending space and time
Moss and damp soil, a symphony of nature's grace
Dreams of peace and tranquility, in this serene embrace

(Chorus)
Dreamy smells fill the air, enchanting all around
A fragrance so opulent, it never will confound
In this scented world I'll roam, forever feeling blessed
Every breath a reminder, life's dreams are manifest

(Verse 4)
By the ocean's edge, the salty breeze entwines
Crisp and briny notes, an invitation to unwind
Seagulls soaring high, their cries carried on the wind
This dreamy coastal melody, my heart will always defend

(Chorus)
Dreamy smells fill the air, enchanting all around
A fragrance so opulent, it never will confound
In this scented world I'll roam, forever feeling blessed
Every breath a reminder, life's dreams are manifest

(Outro)
In a world of dreamy smells, my spirits soar so high
Captivated by their magic, beneath a cerulean sky
Optimistic and inspired, I'll chase these scented dreams
For in their sweet embrace, my soul forever gleams.

The aroma of coffee awakens me, a familiar hello,
Notes of roasted beans twirl in the air,
Guiding me to a world where worries and cares disappear.

To the nostalgic scent of old books, memories restore,
Sweet vanilla lingers, like a warm embrace,
Aromas transport me to a cherished time and place.

Unleashing fantasies, like a playful hand,
From blooming gardens to crackling bonfires,
Every fragrance sets my soul ablaze with desires.

With every whiff, new worlds unfold,
In scents untold, my spirit's behold.
