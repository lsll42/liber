# petition-driving-test-for-people-over-80

In 2014, an 80-year-old woman ran into a crowd of people in Urban Sydney, injuring 2. These scenarios are far too common in modern Australia, and many car accidents, especially near aged care homes, occur as a result of elderly people driving, and ones who may not be cognitively aware enough to engage in the activity.

First and foremost, this is not an attack on elderly people. They, like everyone else, need to get places and driving might be the best way to do that. Elderly individuals between the ages of 65-79 have been medically deemed as “cognitively aware enough to drive” by various international studies - however those older, crossing the age of 80, maybe too impacted mentally to drive by age and other factors that can affect their ability to drive.

Additionally, those over 80 are more prone to diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's that affect cognitive function to a level where driving and operating complex machinery could prove too dangerous for both them and others. An elderly person above 80 wouldn’t be allowed to operate heavy machinery under normal circumstances, so why are they allowed to drive cars with licenses that might not even come from this century?

Nonetheless, even after the 2014 incident and a plethora of ones like it, the Federal or Victorian government did not engage in any law-making that prohibited the driving of people above a certain age or any testing that makes sure they are safe and cleared to do so.

While it is unreasonable to expect an 80-year-old to be completely prohibited from driving freely, our argument is that a cognitive and driving test every 3 years must be compulsory to ensure that they can still, indeed, drive. It should be done every 3 years since that is the turning point of driving capabilities in people that are less mentally aware, to ensure that they still possess the ability to drive without danger.

We urge you to sign our petition and make the Victorian government pass new legislation that makes it compulsory for those above 80 to renew their license via driving tests. Thank you.
