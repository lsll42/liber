## what this vault is about

this vault is dedicated to the storage of all my academic notes.

## types of pages

### source pages

all content in the `sources` folder are source pages: they are not written by me; i just read them

there are different kinds of source pages...

### special pages
#### index pages

- located in `/special/@`
- includes a collection of links

[here](!.md) is the one page to rule them all, the index page that links to all other index pages.

## structure

### folders

instead, a folder is used to contain

### links

this vault mainly uses links to establish structure and the correlation between pages

### tags

we use tags to search for recurrent themes and ideas
